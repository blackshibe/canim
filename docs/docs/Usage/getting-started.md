# Getting Started

## How canim works

Canim loads **animations** which are split into tracks and poses. Poses are regular old animations and poses never move. They are useful for static idle animations.

## todo:

- basic loading
- keyframe_reached
- start, stop
- poses + tracks
- using debug
- rebasing
- advanced rebasing
- fading out
