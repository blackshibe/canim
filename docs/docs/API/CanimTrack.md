# CanimTrack

The class used for tracks in the library. It shares many similiarities with CanimTrack, however canim avoids inheritance.

## Methods

---

### CanimTrack.load_sequence
```ts
CanimTrack.load_sequence(id: string | KeyframeSequence): void
```

Loads the AnimationTrack for the track. Does not yield and fires finished_loading when it's finished.

!!! caution
	Canim calls this automatically. There is no reason to do it yourself.

## Events

---

### CanimTrack.keyframe_reached
```ts
CanimTrack.keyframe_reached: Signal
```

Fires when a named keyframe is stepped over by the animator.

---

### CanimTrack.finished_loading
```ts
CanimTrack.finished_loading: Signal
```

Fires when the animation finishes loading.

!!! caution
	This overwrites the looped property of the pose, so set it after the track finishes loading if you are overwriting it.

---

### CanimTrack.started
```ts
CanimTrack.started: Signal
```

Fires when the animation starts.

---

### CanimTrack.finished
```ts
CanimTrack.finished: Signal
```

Fires when the animation ends.


## Properties


---

### CanimTrack.sequence
```ts
CanimTrack.sequence?: customKeyframe

nil if the animation is unloaded.

---

### CanimTrack.bone_weights
```ts
CanimTrack.bone_weights: { [index: string]: number | undefined } = {};
```

Controls how much individual axis of individual Motor6D Transforms are affected by this animation. <br/>
you can use `__CANIM_DEFAULT_BONE_WEIGHT` for the index to affect all bones:
```ts
    animation.bone_weights.__CANIM_DEFAULT_BONE_WEIGHT = [
    	// x y z
    	[1, 1, 1],
    	// rx ry rz
    	[1, 1, 0.1],
    ];
